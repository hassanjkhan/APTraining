# APTraining

Developed this project with a group for Steacie Library HackFest 2020.

Leverages Tensorflow Library BodyPix to correct your form as you do an over head press. 
- Keeps track of repetitions.
- Tells you when your wrists are imbalanced if one is higher than the other.
- Used google translate to verbally tell you when one of your wrists is higher than the other.
